# advent-of-code

Now with 100% more golang! (It's going to be a long advent of code...)

#### To run:

- Get your data for a given year/day and copy paste it to a file in `data/{YEAR}/{DAY}.txt`.
- Add your code to `year{YEAR}/{DAY}.go` and your tests to `year{YEAR}/{DAY}_test.go`
- Run your solution for a day by running `go run main.go -y={YEAR} -d={DAY}`. To run your tests, add the flag `-test`.
